# Hi there I am Jenushan 
## Junior Data Analyst

## Introduction 
#### I have a keen interest in *data* especially the analytics side to it, with my projects on here and my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Economics helping me explore and hone my skills in it. The projects are part of my specialised training undergone at AiCore and Rockborne, and are part of approximately 2 years of experience in *code development* and 1-year experience in *data management*, *SQL* and *tableau*. This has helped me showcase on here my ability to combine academic knowledge with hands-on industry-level work to enable me to tackle tougher projects and problems that would require solutions by effectively combining *data analysis* and *technological implementation*.
